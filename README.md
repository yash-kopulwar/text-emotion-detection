## Overview
A model which classifies the tweeted texts into four figures of speech - figurative, irony, sarcasm, regular.

## Motivation
Although this may seem to be a small classification problem, but for a machine it is crucial to understand the figurative language to understand the context behind any scentence. When figure of speeches are used in the text, the literal meaning is different than the actual meaning. This may cause problem in language related models.
